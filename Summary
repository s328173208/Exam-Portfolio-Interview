This has helped me understand how to draw and animate with code. This is quite similar to what I've done in another program called Adobe
Animate, but instead of using its settings that are in the program already, you're instead using the code to draw stuff on the canvas and
animate it. It might be hard, but you'll get used to it later on with practice.
